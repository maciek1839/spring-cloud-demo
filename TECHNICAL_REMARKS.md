## Spring REST Docs vs Springdoc
Reference: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-docs-vs-openapi

**Spring REST Docs** is a framework developed by the Spring community in order to create accurate documentation for RESTful APIs. The output of running the tests is created as AsciiDoc files which can be put together using Asciidoctor to generate an HTML page describing our APIs.

**Springdoc OpenAPI UI** can generate UI using Swagger UI.

## Maven commands
- mvn clean install -DskipTests
